# Deep-taylor-decomposition
This repository contains the implementation of Deep Taylor Decomposition (DTD) for visualizing saliency maps in deep neural networks. The code includes the necessary components for loading the ImageNet dataset, preparing the model (VGG or ResNet), and generating saliency maps using DTD.
# Dependencies
## Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

1. argparse: for parsing command-line arguments
2. logging: for logging messages and exceptions
3. PIL: for image processing using Python Imaging Library
4. numpy: for numerical operations in Python
5. cv2: for OpenCV image processing
6. torch: PyTorch deep learning framework
7. torchvision: for working with computer vision datasets and models
## Usage
To use the code for generating saliency maps with DTD, follow these steps:

## Clone the Repository:
Clone this repository to your local machine.

## Install Dependencies:
Install the necessary dependencies using pip or any other package manager.

## Download ImageNet Dataset:
Download the ImageNet dataset and set the --test_dir argument to the directory path containing the dataset.

## Run the Code:
Execute the code using the following command:
